I vave created a python script using which you can download any number of torrent file in  your google drive without using your internet... Afterwards you can download from your google drive with a better bangwidth.
you download this file
then open Google colaboratory
upload this file
I have made this as a project so i have mentioned my name.
If you want you can remove it.
then you follow these steps-


1. Go to 'Runtime'
2. Click on 'Change Runtime Type'
3. Change Hardware Accelerator to GPU and save it
(It will give you better download speed better efficiency and almost 80 GB of extra space in your Drive)
4.Then you install libtorrent python library.
5.Mount your google drive
6.Set proper download path
7.enter magnet link
(you can enter as many magnet link one after another as you want... just by pressing enter)
8. When you finish entering all your magnet link type 'Exit' or 'exit' and press enter
9.if you aren't using magnet link and using .torrent file you can skip the previous process as well and you can enter .torrent file to download your torrent file
